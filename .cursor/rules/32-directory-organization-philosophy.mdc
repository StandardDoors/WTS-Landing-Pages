# Directory Organization Philosophy

Maintain clean separation between different types of files and avoid tools that pollute the home directory with unnecessary initialization files.

## ✅ DO

**Directory Structure Principles**
- Separate configuration files, data files, and applications
- Use dedicated directories for different purposes: `~/Projects/`, `~/Unito/`, etc.
- Keep the home directory clean of application-specific files when possible
- Use `~/.config/` for configuration files that support XDG Base Directory specification

**Project Organization**
- Use logical directory hierarchies: `~/Projects/personal/`, `~/Unito/work-projects/`
- Group related projects together by context (work, personal, experiments)
- Keep project templates and standards consistent across similar projects
- Document project structure and conventions in README files

**Configuration Management**
- Store configurations in version-controlled dotfiles
- Use tools that support clean directory structures (chezmoi, not random dotfile dumps)
- Separate machine-specific configs from universal configs
- Keep backup configurations for critical tools

## ❌ DON'T

**Avoid Directory Pollution**
- Don't use tools that create unnecessary files in home directory (like `warp init` in home)
- Don't let package managers scatter config files everywhere without organization
- Don't mix personal and work projects in the same directory structure
- Don't create deep nested hierarchies that make navigation difficult

**Anti-patterns to Avoid**
- Don't use tools that force their directory structure on you
- Don't accept default locations if they create clutter
- Don't ignore where tools put their files - be intentional about organization
- Don't let tools create initialization files in places you don't want them

## Integration Points

**With Dotfiles Management**
- Use chezmoi for version-controlled config files
- Keep dotfiles repository clean and well-organized
- Document which configs are managed where

**With Development Tools**
- Configure tools to use appropriate directories (`~/.config/` when supported)
- Use project-local configurations when possible
- Avoid global installations that affect all projects unnecessarily

**With Package Managers**
- Use virtual environments and project-local dependencies
- Keep global installations minimal and purposeful
- Document global dependencies and their purposes

This approach maintains a clean, navigable system while supporting efficient development workflows.
