# Development File Cleanup Guidelines

Remove temporary files and development artifacts that shouldn't persist in the codebase, especially before committing to version control.

## Files to Clean Up

### Temporary Files
- `*.tmp`, `*.temp`, `temp-*`
- `*.bak`, `*.backup`, `*.orig`
- `.cache`, `node_modules/.cache`
- OS-specific temporary files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)

### Development Artifacts
- `console.log()`, `console.debug()` statements
- `debugger;` statements  
- Large blocks of commented-out code
- Test files created during development
- Debugging print statements (`print()`, `echo`, etc.)

### Build and Cache Artifacts
- `dist/` directory before new builds (unless ignored)
- `build/` output directories
- `.cache/` directories
- Compiled files that should be regenerated

### Project-Specific Artifacts
- Unused images in asset directories (`src/assets/images/uploads/`)
- Deprecated config files (e.g., `.cursorrules`)
- Temporary data files
- Screenshot files from debugging
- Generated files that should not be committed

## When to Clean Up

### Before Committing
- **Always remove debug code** and temporary files
- Review diff for unintended inclusions
- Clean up console/debug statements
- Remove temporary test code

### After Development Sessions  
- Clean temporary artifacts created during development
- Remove downloaded test files or samples
- Clear debugging output files

### Before Deployment
- Ensure no development files are included in build
- Remove test-specific configurations
- Clean up any hardcoded debugging values

### During Code Review
- Check for overlooked debug statements
- Identify temporary files that slipped through
- Remove experimental code that didn't make it to final solution

### Proactive Cleanup Offers
**After completing tasks or reaching milestones**, proactively offer to clean up temporary files:
- Ask "Should I clean up the temporary files from this work?"
- Be specific about what would be removed
- **Never automatically delete files** - always ask permission
- Provide clear file/folder names and locations
- Explain why files are no longer needed

**Example cleanup offers:**
- "I can remove the `/temp/analysis-data/` folder and the 3 `test-output.json` files"
- "The download cache in `/temp/` is no longer needed. Clean it up?"
- "We have 15 test files from the processing. Keep them or remove?"
- "This analysis created several temp folders in Downloads. Should I clean them up?"

## Cleanup Commands

### Quick Cleanup
```bash
# Remove common temp files
find . -name "*.tmp" -delete
find . -name "*.temp" -delete
find . -name "temp-*" -delete

# Remove backup files
find . -name "*.bak" -delete
find . -name "*.orig" -delete

# Remove OS-specific files
find . -name ".DS_Store" -delete
find . -name "Thumbs.db" -delete
```

### Git-Based Cleanup
```bash
# See untracked files before cleaning
git status --ignored

# Clean untracked files (be careful!)
git clean -n  # dry run first
git clean -fd # remove untracked files and directories

# Remove files from git but keep locally
git rm --cached filename
```

### Code Pattern Cleanup
```bash
# Find console.log statements
grep -r "console\.log" src/ --include="*.js" --include="*.ts"

# Find debugger statements  
grep -r "debugger" src/ --include="*.js" --include="*.ts"

# Find print statements in Python
grep -r "print(" . --include="*.py"
```

### Project-Specific Cleanup
```bash
# Remove dist/build before rebuild
rm -rf dist/ build/

# Clean npm/node artifacts
npm run clean  # if available
rm -rf node_modules/.cache/
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- **Review diffs carefully** before committing to catch overlooked artifacts
- **Use .gitignore** to prevent temporary files from being tracked
- **Set up pre-commit hooks** to automatically clean common artifacts  
- **Document cleanup commands** in project README if project-specific
- **Use build scripts** that clean before building
- **Remove debug code** as you finish each development session

### ❌ DON'T:
- Commit console.log or debug statements to production code
- Leave large commented-out code blocks - remove or document why they're kept
- Include temporary test files in commits
- Skip reviewing the diff - easy to miss temporary files
- Use `git clean -fd` without understanding what it will remove
- Leave hardcoded debugging values in configuration files

## Integration with Workflow

### Pre-commit Checklist
1. **Search for debug statements**: `grep -r "console\.log\|debugger\|print(" src/`
2. **Check for temp files**: `find . -name "*.tmp" -o -name "*.temp"`
3. **Review git status**: `git status` - look for unintended additions
4. **Clean if needed**: Remove identified artifacts
5. **Final review**: Check diff one more time before commit

### Automated Cleanup
Consider setting up:
- Pre-commit hooks that run cleanup commands
- Build scripts that clean before building
- Linting rules that catch debug statements
- `.gitignore` patterns for common temporary files

**Remember: A clean codebase is easier to maintain, debug, and deploy. Make cleanup part of your regular development workflow.**
