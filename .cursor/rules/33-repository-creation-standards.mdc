# Repository Creation Standards

When creating or managing repositories, use consistent tooling and secure defaults to ensure proper repository management practices.

## Implementation

### Repository Creation
✅ **DO:**
- Use GitHub CLI (`gh` command) for repository operations instead of web interfaces
- Default to private repositories unless explicitly told otherwise
- Use `gh repo create repo-name --private` as the standard creation command
- Only use `--public` when specifically requested by the user

❌ **DON'T:**
- Create repositories through web interfaces when CLI is available
- Default to public repositories without explicit user request
- Use inconsistent tooling across repository operations

### Command Standards

**Repository Creation:**
```bash
# Default (secure)
gh repo create project-name --private

# Only when explicitly requested
gh repo create project-name --public

# With additional options
gh repo create project-name --private --description "Project description" --clone
```

**Repository Management:**
```bash
# Consistent use of gh CLI for other operations
gh repo view
gh repo clone owner/repo-name
gh repo fork owner/repo-name
```

## Rationale

- **Security First**: Private by default reduces risk of accidental data exposure
- **Tool Consistency**: Using GitHub CLI provides consistent, scriptable repository management
- **Audit Trail**: CLI operations are easier to track and reproduce than web interface actions
- **Automation Ready**: CLI-based operations integrate better with scripts and workflows
