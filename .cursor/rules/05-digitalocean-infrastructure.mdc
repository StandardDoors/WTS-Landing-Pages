# DigitalOcean Infrastructure Management

Manage DigitalOcean infrastructure for uptime, maintainability, and predictable performance.

## ✅ DO

### Monitoring & Alerts
- **Enable DigitalOcean Monitoring** on all Droplets
- **Set CPU, memory, and disk usage alerts** via email or Slack
- **Use floating IPs** for quick failover and blue/green deployments

### Backups & Recovery
- **Enable automatic weekly backups** on all production Droplets
- **Create manual snapshots** before any major change or deployment
- **Maintain documented restore procedures**
- **Test snapshot recovery** on staging environments regularly

### Scalability & Architecture
- **Use load balancers** to distribute traffic for production workloads
- **Prefer managed services** (Managed Databases, DO Kubernetes) over self-managed instances
- **Use DO Projects** or namespaces to isolate experiments from production
- **Auto-tag Droplets and Spaces** by project + environment

### Networking
- **Enforce private networking** between Droplets where applicable
- **Restrict SSH access** to known IPs using firewalls or VPC
- **Use VPCs** for network isolation between environments

## ❌ DON'T

### Anti-patterns
- Don't rely on single Droplets for production workloads without backup plans
- Don't skip backup verification - test restore procedures
- Don't mix production and development resources in same project
- Don't ignore resource monitoring - set up alerts before problems occur

### Scaling Mistakes
- Don't manually scale without load balancers in place
- Don't use unmanaged services when managed alternatives exist
- Don't forget to tag resources for organization and billing tracking

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Monitoring Setup
```bash
# Enable monitoring via doctl CLI
doctl compute droplet enable-monitoring DROPLET_ID

# Set up basic firewall rules
doctl compute firewall create --name "web-firewall" \
  --inbound-rules "protocol:tcp,ports:80,source_addresses:0.0.0.0/0,::0/0" \
  --inbound-rules "protocol:tcp,ports:443,source_addresses:0.0.0.0/0,::0/0" \
  --inbound-rules "protocol:tcp,ports:22,source_addresses:YOUR_IP/32"
```

### Backup Automation
```bash
# Create snapshot before deployment
doctl compute droplet-action snapshot DROPLET_ID --snapshot-name "pre-deploy-$(date +%Y%m%d)"

# List recent snapshots
doctl compute snapshot list --resource droplet
```

This approach ensures reliable, scalable DigitalOcean infrastructure that can handle production workloads.
