# Systematic Code Crafting

Build solutions incrementally with verification at every step, ensuring each component works before moving to the next.

## Core Methodology

### Build Incrementally
- **One component at a time**: Implement and test each piece before moving to the next
- **Verify functionality**: Test each increment independently before integration
- **Start simple**: Begin with the most basic working version, then enhance
- **Fail fast**: Identify issues early through constant verification

### Verification at Every Step
- **Test after each change**: Run the code/script after every significant modification
- **Validate assumptions**: Use concrete tests to confirm each component works as expected
- **Check integration points**: Verify that new components work with existing ones
- **Measure progress**: Use concrete metrics to confirm functionality

## Development Workflow

### 1. Plan the Approach
- Break down the solution into discrete, testable components
- Identify the smallest working unit to build first
- Map out dependencies and integration points
- Define success criteria for each component

### 2. Implement the Foundation
- Build and test the basic structure
- Ensure the foundation works independently
- Document any assumptions or constraints discovered
- Verify core functionality before adding features

### 3. Add Features Incrementally
- **One feature at a time** with testing
- Verify each feature works before proceeding
- Test integration with existing components
- Maintain working state throughout development

### 4. Integrate Carefully
- Connect components one by one
- Test each integration point thoroughly
- Validate that new features work with existing code
- Resolve conflicts as they arise

### 5. Validate Completeness
- Ensure all requirements are met
- Test end-to-end functionality
- Verify performance and edge cases
- Document the complete solution

## Implementation Guidelines

### When Building New Features
- **Start with a minimal working prototype**
- Add complexity one layer at a time
- Test each layer before adding the next
- Use concrete examples to validate functionality

### When Refactoring Existing Code
- **Make one change at a time**
- Test after each modification
- Ensure the change doesn't break existing functionality
- Verify the refactored code works as expected

### When Integrating Systems
- **Test each system independently first**
- Create a simple integration test
- Add complexity gradually
- Validate the complete integration works

## Key Behaviors

### ✅ DO:
- Stay systematic - follow logical progression
- Build incrementally - one working piece at a time
- Verify constantly - test after every significant change
- Use concrete evidence - test results and metrics over assumptions
- Document progress - keep track of what's been implemented and tested
- Fail fast - identify issues early through constant verification

### ❌ DON'T:
- Jump between solutions without completing current work
- Add multiple features simultaneously without testing
- Skip verification steps to "save time"
- Build large components without incremental testing
- Assume integration will work without testing
- Continue building on broken foundations

## Success Indicators

- Each increment works independently
- Integration points are tested and verified
- The complete solution meets all requirements
- Performance and edge cases are validated
- Code is maintainable and well-documented
- Development process is reproducible and systematic

## Example Workflow

1. **Implement core data structure** → test independently
2. **Add basic functionality** → verify it works with core structure  
3. **Add error handling** → test error scenarios
4. **Integrate with external systems** → test integration points
5. **Add advanced features** → verify they work with existing code
6. **Optimize and finalize** → test complete solution

**Remember: Each step should result in a working system, even if incomplete. Never build on broken foundations.**
