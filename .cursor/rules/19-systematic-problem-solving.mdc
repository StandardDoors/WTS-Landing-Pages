# Systematic Problem-Solving Approach

Never jump to conclusions. Always use a systematic, methodical approach to understanding and solving problems.

## Core principles

- Never jump to conclusions
- Always ask clarifying questions before diagnosing problems
- Break problems down into components before recommending solutions
- Validate assumptions before proposing any fix
- Do not start by problem-solving — start by debugging
- Never invent context or guess intent; ask first

## Debugging protocol

Always debug first — do not attempt a solution before the root cause is clear.

1. **Identify the problem**: Get full logs, error messages, stack traces
   - Clarify vague reports before analyzing the issue
   - Get concrete details: specific error messages, reproduction steps, environment info
   
2. **List and verify likely failure points**: Auth, DB, config, network, etc.
   - Test each point independently starting from the simplest
   - Count and verify - use concrete numbers to confirm scope of issue
   
3. **Investigate systematically**:
   - Start with verification: Check what should be there vs. what actually exists
   - Use command-line tools to validate assumptions (e.g., `unzip -l`, `find`, `wc -l`)
   - Test each component separately before integrating solutions
   - Follow the data: Let evidence guide investigation, not assumptions
   
4. **Evaluate each hypothesis separately**: Isolate the issue before proposing a fix
   - Reproduce the issue in isolation to confirm the root cause
   - If multiple suspects exist, test them separately
   - Use systematic elimination to narrow down the problem
   
5. **Test understanding**: Don't rely on the first Stack Overflow hit — understand the actual failure mode
6. **Eliminate systematically**: If multiple potential causes, eliminate them one by one

7. **Recommend solutions carefully**:
   - Propose solutions only after identifying the root cause
   - Address only the identified issue - avoid scope creep
   - Test the fix before considering the issue resolved
   - Verify the solution resolves the original problem completely

## Implementation Guidelines

### ✅ DO:
- Stay systematic - follow logical progression
- Use concrete evidence - numbers, logs, reproducible steps over assumptions
- Test incrementally - verify each step before moving to the next
- Document findings - track what you've tested and learned
- Build minimal reproducible examples

### ❌ DON'T:
- Jump between solutions without systematic investigation
- Make assumptions without verification
- Skip steps in the debugging process
- Run persistent commands (`npm run dev`, `npm start`) in terminal - use one-shot commands (`npm run build`)
- Fix multiple issues simultaneously

## Confidence and verification

- If unsure, state confidence level explicitly
- Suggest verification steps when uncertain
- Cite relevant standards or documentation when recommending tools or techniques
- Be transparent — explicitly note when something is inferred or uncertain
