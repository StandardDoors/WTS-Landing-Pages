# Daily Development Workflows

Establish consistent, efficient workflows for common development tasks and system maintenance.

## ✅ DO

**Morning Setup Routine**
- Check system status: disk space, running services, updates needed
- Update key repositories and configurations (`chezmoi update`, `git pull` on active projects)
- Verify development environment health (language versions, key services running)
- Review any overnight build failures or alerts

**Project Switching Workflow**
- Use `direnv` to automatically load project-specific environment variables
- Verify correct language versions are active (check `.python-version`, `.nvmrc`)
- Pull latest changes and check for dependency updates
- Run health checks (tests, linting) after switching contexts

**Common Development Operations**
- Use consistent shortcuts and aliases for frequent operations
- Maintain a personal command reference for complex operations
- Use `gh` CLI for GitHub operations instead of web interface when possible
- Keep commonly used Docker commands and configurations readily available

**End-of-Day Cleanup**
- Commit and push work in progress with clear WIP markers
- Close unnecessary applications and free up system resources
- Back up any important configuration changes
- Review and clean up temporary files and downloads

## ❌ DON'T

**Avoid Inefficient Patterns**
- Don't manually recreate the same environment setups repeatedly
- Don't skip environment verification when switching projects
- Don't leave uncommitted changes without clear tracking
- Don't accumulate system clutter without regular cleanup

**Bad Habits to Avoid**
- Don't rely on memory for complex command sequences - document them
- Don't skip backing up configurations before making changes
- Don't ignore system health indicators (disk space, memory usage)
- Don't let temporary solutions become permanent without proper implementation

## Quick Reference Commands

**System Status**
```bash
# Disk space and system health
df -h
top -l 1 | head -10
brew doctor  # if using Homebrew
```

**Git Operations**
```bash
# Quick status across projects
find ~/Projects -name .git -type d -exec dirname {} \; | xargs -I {} sh -c 'echo "\n=== {} ==="; git -C {} status --porcelain'

# Common GitHub CLI operations
gh repo list
gh pr status
gh issue list --assignee @me
```

**Development Environment**
```bash
# Verify language versions
python --version && which python
node --version && which node
docker --version && docker ps

# direnv status
direnv status
env | grep -E "(API_KEY|TOKEN)"
```

**Project Templates**
- Maintain templates for new project initialization
- Include standard files: README.md, .gitignore, .envrc template, basic CI/CD
- Keep language-specific templates (Python with poetry, Node with package.json)
- Document project setup steps that can't be automated

## Integration with AI Tools

**AI Rule Management**
- Keep AI rules updated as development practices evolve
- Use rulebook-ai project sync to apply rules to new projects
- Document any project-specific AI rule requirements
- Regular review of AI-generated code against established standards

**Automation Opportunities**
- Script repetitive setup tasks
- Use make files or task runners for common project operations
- Automate environment verification and health checks
- Create shortcuts for complex multi-step operations

This approach creates predictable, efficient workflows that scale across different projects and development contexts.
