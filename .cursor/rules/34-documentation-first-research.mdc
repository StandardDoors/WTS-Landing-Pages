# Documentation-First Research Protocol

## Core Principle

**ALWAYS research official documentation thoroughly before attempting any custom implementation, workaround, or third-party solution.**

## Research Protocol

### 1. Official Documentation Deep Dive
✅ **DO:**
- Search the complete official documentation, not just getting started guides
- Look specifically for:
  - Built-in features that solve your exact use case
  - Template systems, themes, or layout options
  - Configuration options and frontmatter
  - Advanced features and reference sections
- Check examples, tutorials, and advanced guides
- Look for "reference" sections which often contain comprehensive feature lists

❌ **DON'T:**
- Skip to Stack Overflow or tutorials without exhausting official docs
- Assume a feature doesn't exist because it's not in the getting started guide
- Start with custom implementations before confirming no built-in solution exists

### 2. Documentation Search Strategy
✅ **Search for these patterns:**
- Templates, themes, layouts
- Configuration, frontmatter, options
- Built-in components or features
- Override, customize, extend
- Advanced features, reference guides

### 3. Framework-Specific Research
✅ **For any framework/tool:**
- Check the complete API reference
- Look for plugin/extension ecosystems
- Search for "recipes" or "guides" sections
- Check GitHub discussions, issues, and examples
- Review changelog for recent feature additions

## Implementation Rule

**Only after exhaustive documentation research should you consider:**
1. Custom implementations
2. Third-party libraries
3. Workarounds or hacks
4. Overriding core functionality

## Real-World Example

❌ **What happened:** Weeks spent creating custom landing page overrides for Astro Starlight
✅ **What should have happened:** Found the built-in `splash` template in the frontmatter reference documentation in 10 minutes

## Verification Questions

Before any custom implementation, ask:
1. Have I read the complete official documentation?
2. Have I checked the API reference section?
3. Have I searched for built-in templates, themes, or layouts?
4. Have I looked at the configuration/frontmatter options?
5. Does this framework have a feature that already solves this exact problem?

## Time Investment Rule

Spend at least 30 minutes in official documentation before considering custom solutions. Complex frameworks may require 1-2 hours of documentation research.
