# Project Templates & Standards

Establish consistent project initialization and development standards to ensure quality and maintainability across all projects.

## ✅ DO

**Project Template Components**
- Create template repositories for common project types (Python, Node.js, Astro, WordPress)
- Include essential files in templates: README.md, .gitignore, .envrc template, LICENSE
- Add basic CI/CD configuration appropriate for the project type
- Include development environment setup instructions
- Provide code quality tools configuration (linting, formatting, testing)

**README.md Standards**
- Include clear project description and purpose
- Document installation and setup requirements
- Provide usage examples and common commands
- Include contribution guidelines and development setup
- Document environment variables and configuration requirements

**Code Quality Standards**
- Set up automatic code formatting (black, prettier, etc.)
- Configure linting rules appropriate for the language/framework
- Include basic test structure and examples
- Set up pre-commit hooks where beneficial
- Document coding conventions and style guidelines

**Project Structure Conventions**
- Use consistent directory structures within project types
- Separate source code, tests, documentation, and configuration
- Include scripts directory for common development tasks
- Use standard locations for configuration files
- Document any deviations from standard structure

## ❌ DON'T

**Template Maintenance Mistakes**
- Don't let templates become outdated with old dependencies or practices
- Don't include sensitive information or credentials in templates
- Don't create overly complex templates that obscure simple projects
- Don't skip documentation of template choices and conventions

**Project Setup Anti-patterns**
- Don't skip project setup automation when it would save repeated work
- Don't ignore established conventions without good reason
- Don't mix different architectural patterns within the same project type
- Don't leave placeholder content in production-ready projects

## Template Categories

**Backend Projects (Python/Node.js/etc.)**
- Virtual environment setup instructions
- Database configuration examples
- API documentation structure
- Environment variable templates
- Docker configuration for development and production

**Frontend Projects (React/Astro/etc.)**
- Build tool configuration
- Asset management setup
- Component organization structure
- Testing framework integration
- Deployment pipeline configuration

**WordPress Projects**
- Theme/plugin development structure
- Local development environment (Docker/Local)
- Build tools for assets (Webpack/Vite)
- WordPress coding standards configuration
- Deployment and staging procedures

**Full-Stack Projects**
- Monorepo or multi-repo organization
- Shared configuration management
- Development environment orchestration
- Cross-service communication patterns
- Integrated testing strategies

## Integration with AI Rules

**Rulebook-AI Integration**
- Include .rulebook-ai configuration in project templates
- Document which AI rule packs are recommended for each project type
- Provide project-specific AI rules when needed
- Keep AI rules consistent with project conventions

**Code Generation Standards**
- Establish patterns for AI-generated code review
- Document when AI assistance is appropriate vs. manual coding
- Include AI-generated code attribution in comments when helpful
- Maintain consistency between AI-generated and manually written code

## Quality Assurance

**Template Testing**
- Regularly test project templates on clean environments
- Verify all dependencies install correctly
- Test that basic project functions work out of the box
- Update templates when dependencies or practices change

**Documentation Maintenance**
- Keep setup instructions current with actual requirements
- Test documentation steps on different operating systems when relevant
- Update examples and screenshots when interfaces change
- Gather feedback from developers using the templates

**Version Management**
- Tag template versions to allow rollback if needed
- Document major changes and migration paths
- Keep changelog of template updates
- Coordinate template updates with team practices

## Automation Opportunities

**Project Initialization**
- Create scripts to generate projects from templates
- Automate initial git setup and remote configuration
- Set up development environment with single command when possible
- Generate project-specific documentation from templates

**Maintenance Scripts**
- Create scripts to update existing projects with template changes
- Automate dependency updates across similar projects
- Generate reports on project compliance with standards
- Batch update common configuration changes

This approach ensures consistent, high-quality project initialization while reducing repetitive setup work and maintaining standards across all development efforts.
