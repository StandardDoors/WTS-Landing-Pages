# Cloud Services & CLI Standards

Establish consistent configuration and usage patterns for cloud service CLIs and API integrations.

## ✅ DO

**AWS CLI Configuration**
- Use named profiles for different AWS accounts/environments
- Configure profiles with descriptive names: `personal`, `work-dev`, `work-prod`
- Set default regions appropriate for each profile
- Use AWS SSO when available for better security
- Store profiles in `~/.aws/config` and credentials in `~/.aws/credentials`

**GitHub CLI (gh) Best Practices**
- Authenticate using `gh auth login` with appropriate scopes
- Use SSH keys for repository operations
- Configure default settings for common operations
- Use `gh` for workflow automation instead of web interface when possible
- Set up aliases for frequently used commands

**Docker Configuration**
- Configure Docker daemon settings appropriately for development
- Use BuildKit by default for improved build performance
- Set up multi-platform builds when needed
- Configure resource limits to prevent system impact
- Keep commonly used Docker commands documented and accessible

**Service Integration Principles**
- Use environment-based configuration (development, staging, production)
- Keep service credentials in appropriate secret management (direnv, not hardcoded)
- Document which services require which credentials
- Use service-specific CLI tools when available rather than generic HTTP clients

## ❌ DON'T

**Avoid Configuration Mistakes**
- Don't use default/unnamed profiles for production services
- Don't hardcode credentials in scripts or configuration files
- Don't mix development and production credentials in the same profile
- Don't ignore CLI tool updates that might include security fixes

**Security Anti-patterns**
- Don't store credentials in version control
- Don't use overly broad permissions when specific scopes are available
- Don't skip environment-specific configurations
- Don't share credentials between different environments or projects

## Configuration Examples

**AWS CLI Profile Setup**
```ini
# ~/.aws/config
[profile personal]
region = us-west-2
output = json

[profile work-dev]
region = us-east-1
output = json
sso_start_url = https://company.awsapps.com/start

[profile work-prod]
region = us-east-1
output = json
sso_start_url = https://company.awsapps.com/start
```

**GitHub CLI Configuration**
```bash
# Set up useful aliases
gh alias set prs 'pr list --assignee @me'
gh alias set issues 'issue list --assignee @me'
gh alias set co 'pr checkout'

# Configure default behavior
gh config set git_protocol ssh
gh config set editor vim
```

**Common Docker Commands Reference**
```bash
# Development workflow
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f
docker system prune  # cleanup

# Multi-platform builds
docker buildx create --use
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64
```

## Service-Specific Guidelines

**AWS Services**
- Use least-privilege IAM policies
- Prefer temporary credentials over long-lived access keys
- Use AWS profiles for different environments
- Document which AWS services each project uses

**GitHub Integration**
- Use GitHub CLI for repository operations
- Set up repository templates with consistent structure
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD when appropriate
- Keep issue and PR templates updated

**Docker Workflow**
- Use multi-stage builds for production images
- Keep Docker images minimal and secure
- Use .dockerignore files appropriately
- Document container dependencies and networking requirements

## Backup and Recovery

**Credential Backup**
- Keep secure backups of important credentials (LastPass, 1Password, etc.)
- Document credential recovery procedures
- Test credential recovery process periodically
- Keep emergency access methods documented

**Configuration Backup**
- Include CLI configurations in dotfiles management
- Back up service-specific settings and preferences
- Document service integrations and dependencies
- Keep setup procedures documented for new machines

This approach ensures reliable, secure access to cloud services while maintaining good security practices and operational consistency.
